Inspired by Tom going through all sec-want bugs, I'm looking at this bug again.
Out of convenience, I'll quote myself from some place else:

There have been numerous discussions, the latest one in late 2016 and we
had come to the conclusion that it is currently not worth the effort for
Firefox to provide a built-in feature:

An XSS filter can not protect against stored (aka persistent) XSS or DOM
XSS, which has become more and more prevalent recently.
An XSS filter is prone to security holes if not maintained very
diligently and actively. It is hard to justify security engineering time
on a feature that provides limited value.
Lastly, there is an XSS filter in NoScript that people can use.
